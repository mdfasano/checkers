# Psuedocode  
I want to write this code such that adding functionality for additional games with similar logic is relatively easy. I plan on using generic classes for the required game elements and then creating checkers specific subclasses that extend those baseline classes.
---
### Required Constants
- object to hold the height and width of the game board
- an array of arrays to represent the game board tiles
- a colors object using -1, 0 and 1 as keys for RED, EMPTY, and WHITE player piece markers


### Cached DOM Elements
- game board element
- resign button
- play again button
- win/loss counter element
## Global Variables

## On Load...

## Classes 
### BoardGame 
### CheckersGame
> extends BoardGame
### GameBoard 
### BoardTile  
> (maybe?) extends GameBoard
### Graveyard 
### PlayerPiece 
### CheckersPiece 
> extends PlayerPiece
